# Headcount 2.0

Headcount 2.0 gives the user the ability to pull statistical data on students within school districts in Colorado. By selecting two different district cards a third card is rendered that compares the two district cards. 

### Team

This was a solo project built by me, Jesse McFadden. The main goal of the project was to successfully parse through a complicated dataset and have the data rendered properly on the DOM. 

### UI 

To search for a specific district, simply type into the search input field. To compare two districts, click on the first district you would like to compare, then the second.
